# Credit Card Fraud-Detection (AIML Project)

# Overview
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) technologies to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By developing intelligent systems that can automatically identify potentially fraudulent transactions using transaction data, we aim to enhance the security of financial transactions and reduce financial losses due to fraud.

# Features
1. Fraud Detection: Machine learning models to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on transaction data.

# Technologies Used
1. Programming Languages: Python
2. Libraries: Numpy, Pandas
3. Machine Learning Frameworks: Scikit-learn
4. Tools: Google Colab

# Usage
1. Data Collection: Gather transaction data including features such as transaction amount, time, and other relevant variables.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to scale features, to balance the dataset.
3. Gather insights from data.
4. Model Training: Train machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
5. Evaluate the Model Accuracy: Assess the performance of the model by comparing the accuracy of training and testing data.

# Dataset Information
1. Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
2. V1, V2, ..., V28: Result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features are not provided.
3. Amount: Transaction amount.
4. Class: Class label, where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a legitimate transaction.

# Conclusion
The logistic regression model is used to detect fraudulent transactions with an accuracy of approximately 97.5% on the training data and 96.7% on the testing data.
